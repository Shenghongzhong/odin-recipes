## Introduction

Everyone starts with HTML but ends with CSS. I'm interested to know how far I can go with this. I recently joined a Full Stack Development Bootcamp in Feb 2023, but unfortuantely due to their overestimates, they decided to stop the bootcamp and refunded everything to us. Although I fully understood their decisions, it still affects people like me expecting to get feet into software engineering. 

So I got back to the odin project and follow with the course from Meta on Coursera. 

## A few notes


### HTML Document Model 

I have been trying really hard to get myself into a programme called Founders and Coders but the criteria is really hard. Of which, there is a project about manipulating HTML DOM. 

Initially, I thought HTML DOM was a hard concept. But it is just a fancy name for a tree model.

Ages ago, I wrote an article [Web scraping tutorial for beginners](https://medium.com/p/385a2ac27107) where I mentioned how the World Wide Web works.
When you browse the Internet, you use browser. The browser is a softwre living in the client (Your computer or device) to send a request to a web server, and the server will response to your request, thanks to the Internet protocols. HTTP is one of the protocols (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems that allows users to communicate data on the World Wide Web.

HTML is a document sent between. Your browser will download the html and render it.

### HTML 

HTML is a text document containing simple webpage formatting. 

The completion of the project will demonstrate skill points as follows:

- Identify the structured of an HTML document
- Create a basic webpage
